Popeye Learn – E-Learning Platform (Frontend Only)

This project is a multi-page front-end design of a beginner-level e-learning platform, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed as part of an internship task under The Code Tech.

The platform simulates a learning environment with a course listing, embedded video playback, and basic progress tracking functionality using static front-end tools.

- script.js – JavaScript file for progress bar interactivity


Features:

- Each course links to a separate detail page
- Embedded YouTube videos for each course
- Static progress bar UI with a “Mark as Completed” button
- Responsive design for various screen sizes


Technologies Used:
