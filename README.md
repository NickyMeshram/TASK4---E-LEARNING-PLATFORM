Popeye Learn – E-Learning Platform (Frontend Only)

This project is a multi-page front-end design of a beginner-level e-learning platform, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed as part of an internship task under The Code Tech.

The platform simulates a learning environment with a course listing, embedded video playback, and basic progress tracking functionality using static front-end tools.

- course.html – HTML course detail page
- course-css.html – CSS course detail page
- course-js.html – JavaScript course detail page
- style.css – Main stylesheet for layout and responsiveness
- script.js – JavaScript file for progress bar interactivity


Features:

- Styled homepage with multiple course cards
- Each course links to a separate detail page
- Embedded YouTube videos for each course
- Static progress bar UI with a “Mark as Completed” button
- Responsive design for various screen sizes


Technologies Used:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation)


How to Run:

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any browser
3. Click on “View Course” to explore different course pages
4. Interact with the progress bar by clicking “Mark as Completed”
